								<span>Yea, Oedipus, my sovereign lord and king,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thou seest how both extremes of age besiege</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy palace altars⁠—fledglings hardly winged,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And greybeards bowed with years; priests, as am I</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Zeus, and these the flower of our youth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Meanwhile, the common folk, with wreathèd boughs</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Both shrines of Pallas congregate, or where</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ismenus gives his oracles by fire.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For, as thou seest thyself, our ship of State,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sore buffeted, can no more lift her head,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Foundered beneath a weltering surge of blood.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A blight is on our harvest in the ear,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A blight upon the grazing flocks and herds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A blight on wives in travail; and withal</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Armed with his blazing torch the God of Plague</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath swooped upon our city emptying</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The house of Cadmus, and the murky realm</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Pluto is full fed with groans and tears.</span>

								<span>Therefore, O King, here at thy hearth we sit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I and these children; not as deeming thee</span>

								<span>A new divinity, but the first of men;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>First in the common accidents of life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And first in visitations of the Gods.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Art thou not he who coming to the town</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Cadmus freed us from the tax we paid</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To the fell songstress? Nor hadst thou received</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Prompting from us or been by others schooled;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No, by a god inspired (so all men deem,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And testify) didst thou renew our life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And now, O Oedipus, our peerless king,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All we thy votaries beseech thee, find</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some succour, whether by a voice from heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whispered, or haply known by human wit.</span>

								<span>Tried counsellors, methinks, are aptest found<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></span>

								<br/>
								<span>Look to thy laurels! for thy zeal of yore</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our country’s saviour thou art justly hailed:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O never may we thus record thy reign:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“He raised us up only to cast us down.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Uplift us, build our city on a rock.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy happy star ascendant brought us luck,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O let it not decline! If thou wouldst rule</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This land, as now thou reignest, better sure</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To rule a peopled than a desert realm.</span>

								<span>Mind you, I speak as one who comes a stranger</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To this report, no less than to the crime;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For how unaided could I track it far</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Without a clue? Which lacking (for too late</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was I enrolled a citizen of Thebes)</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This proclamation I address to all:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thebans, if any knows the man by whom</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Laius, son of Labdacus, was slain,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I summon him to make clean shrift to me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And if he shrinks, let him reflect that thus</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Confessing he shall ’scape the capital charge;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the worst penalty that shall befall him</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is banishment⁠—unscathed he shall depart.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But if an alien from a foreign land</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be known to any as the murderer,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let him who knows speak out, and he shall have</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Due recompense from me and thanks to boot.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But if ye still keep silence, if through fear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For self or friends ye disregard my hest,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hear what I then resolve: I lay my ban</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On the assassin whosoe’er he be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let no man in this land, whereof I hold</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sovereign rule, harbour or speak to him,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Give him no part in prayer or sacrifice</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or lustral rites, but hound him from your homes.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For this is our defilement, so the god</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath lately shown to me by oracles.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus as their champion I maintain the cause</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Both of the god and of the murdered King.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And on the murderer this curse I lay</span>
								<br/>
								<span>(On him and all the partners in his guilt):⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wretch, may he pine in utter wretchedness!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And for myself, if with my privity</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He gain admittance to my hearth, I pray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The curse I laid on others fall on me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>See that ye give effect to all my hest,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For my sake and the god’s and for our land,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A desert blasted by the wrath of heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For, let alone the god’s express command,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It were a scandal ye should leave unpurged</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The murder of a great man and your king,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor track it home. And now that I am lord,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Successor to his throne, his bed, his wife,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>(And had he not been frustrate in the hope</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of issue, common children of one womb</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Had forced a closer bond twixt him and me,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But Fate swooped down upon him), therefore I</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His blood-avenger will maintain his cause</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though he were my sire, and leave no stone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unturned to track the assassin or avenge</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The son of Labdacus, of Polydore,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Cadmus, and Agenor first of the race.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And for the disobedient thus I pray:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May the gods send them neither timely fruits</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of earth, nor teeming increase of the womb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But may they waste and pine, as now they waste,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Aye and worse stricken; but to all of you,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My loyal subjects who approve my acts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May Justice, our ally, and all the gods</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be gracious and attend you evermore.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Hath scot or lot in the prophetic art.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Here is the proof in brief. An oracle</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Once came to Laius (I will not say</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twas from the Delphic god himself, but from</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His ministers) declaring he was doomed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To perish by the hand of his own son,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A child that should be born to him by me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now Laius⁠—so at least report affirmed⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was murdered on a day by highwaymen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No natives, at a spot where three roads meet.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As for the child, it was but three days old,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When Laius, its ankles pierced and pinned</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Together, gave it to be cast away</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By others on the trackless mountain side.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So then Apollo brought it not to pass</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The child should be his father’s murderer,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or the dread terror find accomplishment,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Laius be slain by his own son.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such was the prophet’s horoscope. O king,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Regard it not. Whate’er the god deems fit</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To search, himself unaided will reveal.</span>

								<span>And thou shalt not be frustrate of thy wish,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now my imaginings have gone so far.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who has a higher claim that thou to hear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My tale of dire adventures? Listen then.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My sire was Polybus of Corinth, and</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My mother Merope, a Dorian;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I was held the foremost citizen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till a strange thing befell me, strange indeed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet scarce deserving all the heat it stirred.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A roisterer at some banquet, flown with wine,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shouted “Thou art not true son of thy sire.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It irked me, but I stomached for the nonce</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The insult; on the morrow I sought out</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My mother and my sire and questioned them.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They were indignant at the random slur</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cast on my parentage and did their best</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To comfort me, but still the venomed barb</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rankled, for still the scandal spread and grew.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So privily without their leave I went</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To Delphi, and Apollo sent me back</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Baulked of the knowledge that I came to seek.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But other grievous things he prophesied,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Woes, lamentations, mourning, portents dire;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To wit I should defile my mother’s bed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And raise up seed too loathsome to behold,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And slay the father from whose loins I sprang.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Warned by the oracle I turned and fled⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Corinth henceforth was to me unknown</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Save as I knew its region by the stars;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whither, I cared not, so I never might</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Behold my doom of infamy fulfilled.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in my wanderings I reached the place</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where, as thy story runs, the king was slain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then, lady⁠—thou shalt hear the very truth⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As I drew near the triple-branching roads,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A herald met me and a man who sat</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a car drawn by colts⁠—as in thy tale⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The man in front and the old man himself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Threatened to thrust me rudely from the path,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then jostled by the charioteer in wrath</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I struck him, and the old man, seeing this,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Watched till I passed and from his car brought down</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Full on my head the double-pointed goad.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Yet was I quits with him and more; one stroke</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of my good staff sufficed to fling him clean</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of the chariot seat and laid him prone.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And so I slew them every one. But if</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Betwixt this stranger there was aught in common</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With Laius, who more miserable than I,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What mortal could you find more god-abhorred?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wretch whom no sojourner, no citizen</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May harbour or address, whom all are bound</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To harry from their homes. And this same curse</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was laid on me, and laid by none but me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yea with these hands all gory I pollute</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The bed of him I slew. Say, am I vile?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Am I not utterly unclean, a wretch</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Doomed to be banished, and in banishment</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Forgo the sight of all my dearest ones,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And never tread again my native earth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or else to wed my mother and slay my sire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Polybus, who begat me and upreared?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If one should say, this is the handiwork</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of some inhuman power, who could blame</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His judgment? But, ye pure and awful gods,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Forbid, forbid that I should see that day!</span>
								<br/>

								<span>With both her hands, and, once within the room,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>She shut the doors behind her with a crash.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“Laius,” she cried, and called her husband dead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Long, long ago; her thought was of that child</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By him begot, the son by whom the sire</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was murdered and the mother left to breed</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Husband by husband, children by her child.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What happened after that I cannot tell,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor how the end befell, for with a shriek</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Burst on us Oedipus; all eyes were fixed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On Oedipus, as up and down he strode,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor could we mark her agony to the end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For stalking to and fro “A sword!” he cried,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“Where is the wife, no wife, the teeming womb</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That bore a double harvest, me and mine?”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in his frenzy some supernal power</span>
								<br/>
								<span>(No mortal, surely, none of us who watched him)</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Guided his footsteps; with a terrible shriek,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though one beckoned him, he crashed against</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The folding doors, and from their staples forced</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The wrenchèd bolts and hurled himself within.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then we beheld the woman hanging there,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A running noose entwined about her neck.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But when he saw her, with a maddened roar</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He loosed the cord; and when her wretched corpse</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lay stretched on earth, what followed⁠—O ’twas dread!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He tore the golden brooches that upheld</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her queenly robes, upraised them high and smote</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Full on his eye-balls, uttering words like these:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“No more shall ye behold such sights of woe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Deeds I have suffered and myself have wrought;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Henceforward quenched in darkness shall ye see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Those ye should ne’er have seen; now blind to those</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom, when I saw, I vainly yearned to know.”</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Such was the burden of his moan, whereto,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not once but oft, he struck with his hand uplift</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His eyes, and at each stroke the ensanguined orbs</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bedewed his beard, not oozing drop by drop,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But one black gory downpour, thick as hail.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such evils, issuing from the double source,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have whelmed them both, confounding man and wife.</span>
